## Database Set Up

This app has been tested with mysql 5.7 with mysqli extension, php 7.1, and chrome 68.

There is a creation script in db/schema.sql

The database can be configured in settings/settings.ini
(if you change the database name in setting.ini, you must change it in schema.sql)

Just a note about normalization... I thought about normalizing the email address and
possibly the name as well. However, given the small size of the data structure,
this seemed like over-engineering. I just wanted to note that this was a conscious
design decision.

I also thought about restricting duplicate entries, but the requirements did not
specify if this was a requirement, so arguably duplicates could be desired.
Again, I just wanted to acknowledge this was an intentional design decision.

NOTE: I understand you will be testing unit tests with the command "phpunit"
Please add " ." on to the end of the command like:

phpunit .

Thank you.

Welcome to the Dealer Inspire PHP Code challenge.

## Getting Started

First thing's first - you'll need to fork this git repository to somewhere else.
Make sure that your source code is publicly available in a git repository when
you're done.  (Like Bitbucket or GitHub.  If you're super-nerdy and host your
own public repo, just make sure the server is up 24/7 - our code-review monkeys
like to work in the middle of the night.)  

You don't have to host a working copy of the code, we'll be checking it out locally
to review it.  That's a good reminder - we'll be testing your code by running the following
commands:

```
cd your-repo-checkout
phpunit
php -S 127.0.0.1:9999 -t public
```

Our working directory will be your git repo checkout.  We'll run PHPUnit in that directory.
If all the tests pass, we may browse to it using the built-in PHP server, expecting
your publicly browsable code in the `public` folder.

## What's Provided

We've provided this repository for you to fork.  Inside, you'll find a Bootstrap-based
template HTML file with a placeholder for your challenge.  You are not expected to make any
design changes or add anything to the template.  However, we'd expect that the code challenge part
(it's a form) at least matches the style of this website. (The styling is built into the
template.)

## The Challenge

Please create a contact form in the contact form page of the website template.  Your contact
form should contain the following required fields:

- Full Name
- Email
- Message

You should also have the following non-required fields:

- Phone

Once valid information is received from the form, two processes should occur.

First, email a copy of the contact request to `guy-smiley@example.com`

Second, keep a copy of the contact form in a database so that we can review the contact form later.
You do not need to provide an interface to access that data (for example, there will be no admin login).

## Expectations

Your contact form should be in valid HTML in our template. It should match the style of the template.

Your back-end processing should be done in PHP. You may use a framework, or plain PHP - either is fine.

Your contact form data should be validated.

One copy of the data should be emailed to the owner (listed above).  You can choose either HTML or plaintext email (or a combination).

One copy of the data should be kept in a MySQL, MongoDB or Postgres database.

Some indication that the contact form has been sent should be given.

You should have PHPUnit-compatible unit tests for your application.

Provide either a database schema file or a programmatic way of creating your database / tables.

The completed work is available in a public git repository for us to checkout and review.
